# California Voter Guide
This is a google assistant app using NLP to understand voice queries and provide info about propositions about [California June 5 2018 elections](http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/). You can ask questions like:
* Tell me about promosition 69
* Give me list of propositions
* Who is for proposition 68?
* Waht are the cons of proposition 70
* ... and many others.

The app was created with the help of [Google Dialog Flow](https://developers.google.com/actions/dialogflow/), a little big of NodeJS and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). It helped to prove "beyond the reasonable doubt" that Google DialogFlow works, can underatand spoken and written texts, extract specific chunks ot of it and pass them to code for execution.

TODO: integrate this app with things like:
* Microsoft Skype
* Telegram
* Slack
* Viber
* Twitter
